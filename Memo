A tree structure is ideal for the doctor reporting system because it naturally represents hierarchical relationships. Each doctor can supervise one or more doctors beneath them, similar to how tree nodes have left and right children. This structure makes it efficient to visualize and manage reporting lines while keeping relationships well-organized and easy to traverse for analysis or record retrieval. Preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals each serve different purposes in software engineering. Preorder is useful when saving or copying a tree structure since it visits the root before its children. Inorder is common when data needs to be processed in a sorted or logical sequence, such as displaying hierarchical records in order of responsibility. Postorder is often used in cleanup or evaluation tasks, such as deleting nodes or computing cumulative results from the bottom up. Heaps, specifically min-heaps, are essential for simulating real-time systems like emergency intake queues. In such systems, the most urgent patient must always be treated first, regardless of arrival order. A min-heap ensures that the patient with the lowest urgency score (i.e., the highest priority) can be accessed in constant time. This efficient prioritization allows the emergency system to dynamically handle new patients and remove treated ones while maintaining an optimized and fair processing order, reflecting real-world emergency management logic.
